# 🐍 AI-Powered Snake Game

A modern **AI-powered Snake Game** built with React, Tailwind CSS, and SVG.  
Around **95% of the code** was generated using AI, and I customized it with new features, visuals, and logic adjustments.  

This project demonstrates how combining **AI assistance with developer creativity** can quickly produce a fun, interactive, and visually polished game.
